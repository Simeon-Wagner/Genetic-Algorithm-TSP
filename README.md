# Genetic-Algorithm-TSP
One of my first bigger coding projects.
The program takes in a list of points representing cities and their location.
The algorithm than thakes an heuristic approach to find the shortest hamiltonian cycle in the graph by using an evolutionary algorithm.
It is a pure Java based program since this is the language I learned at the university. 
In the GUI the evolutionary approach is visualized, by displaying the fittest individual of each generational cycle.
